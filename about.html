          This platform is a proud product of Noor Fatima Healthcare Group, dedicated to transforming how healthcare is accessed across Kashmir and beyond. Launched in 2025, it represents a new chapter in a journey that began with a small community pharmacy built on the principles of care, trust, and service.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these modest beginnings, the platform has evolved into a modern digital solution — offering reliable medicine delivery, patient support, and easy access to healthcare services, all from the comfort of home.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are continuously developing and enhancing this platform — introducing new features, improving performance, and adapting to your needs — to serve you better every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backed by the values of accessibility, compassion, and innovation, Noor Fatima Healthcare Group remains committed to delivering dependable healthcare — not just to Kashmir, but to every community we can reach.
